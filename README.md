Description:
This assignment consists of two physics problems related to diffraction and interference.

Problem #1: Which Slit Bent the Light More

Implemented a program to determine which slit causes the most diffraction.
The program takes inputs for wavelength (Î»), order (m), and slit widths (a).
It checks the valid wavelength range (380 nm - 750 nm) and calculates diffraction angles.
The output determines which slit bent the light the most.

Problem #2: Diffraction Grating Calculation

Developed a program to calculate the diffraction angle for a second-order bright spot for red light.
Used given information about a third-order bright spot for green light.
Applied the diffraction grating formula to find the required angle.
Implementation:
The assignment was solved using C.
The code takes user inputs, performs calculations using physics formulas, and outputs the results.
Proper validation for wavelength ranges was implemented.
